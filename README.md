## Introduction
In terms of card payments, unauthorized card payment is considered fraudulent. These are transactions in which cardholders are not direct or indirectly involved in the transactions. Fraudulent transactions can happen in different ways; for example Account -Take-Over where the fraudster takes ownership of the cardholder's account, cone of the cardholder's card, and more.

There's a need for the card issuer to have measures to prevent unauthorized payments/activities. We know that some card issuers use chargebacks to retrieve money back for some unauthorized payments; however, it is not 100% guaranteed the recovery of funds, and in some cases becomes an inconvenient for the cardholders to have unauthorized payments.
